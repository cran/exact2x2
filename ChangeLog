1.4.1
 - fix Table for Case-Control studies in exact McNemar vignette (thanks to Eric Leifer for pointing out the error).  
 - fix ss2x2 so that it does not run forever in certain situations. The problem was that the exact calculation assumes that the starting value underestimates the power. Now we check to make sure that is true, and if not change the starting value. (Thanks to Wolfgang Hartman for pointing out this error).



1.4.0
 - fix binomMeld.test when values are at the extremes for the difference test. See code for changes. Also created doc file giving the details.
- update citations



1.3.0
 - add functions to calculate exact sample size and power
 - add function to calculate the melded binomial confidence interval. Provides confidence intervals for difference, ratio, and odds ratio designed to guarantee coverage. 


1.2-0.0
- fix McNemar's test (exact2x2 paired=TRUE) so that if both off diagonal values are 0, then gives p-value of 1 instead of error.
- moved vignettes to vignette directory


1.1-1.0
- fix problem for exact2x2 function when input uses `x,y'-style input and both x and y are factors with 2 levels, 
  but one of x or y has only one level observed.(Thanks to Hamilton Gross for finding this error).


1.1-0.0
- fix problem with the exact2x2CI function. Now calculates this in a much faster and more accurate way. Previously, 
  it gave incorrect intervals for the tsmethod="minlike" in some cases with large counts. See comments in 
  interval function within exact2x2CI function of R code. (Thanks to Nan Bing for finding this error).

1.0-1.1
- update CITATION file

1.0-1
- update reference to Fay (2009) to reflect print version, Fay (2010)
- add plot option to exact2x2 function to plot p-value function
- change exact2x2Plot and internal function so that method is now tsmethod

1.0-0
- add exact McNemar's test (paired=TRUE), for that the package now depends on the exactci package
- add envir=parent.frame to do.call in fisher.exact, without it gave error if name of first input is "y"
- do same as above for blaker.exact
- update reference to Fay (2009), add citation file



0.9-3

- fix problem with exact2x2CI, gave wrong confidence interval for some 2x2 tables
- fix conf.int=FALSE to work correctly for 'blaker' and 'minlike' methods, still ignored for 'central'
- fix p-value for blaker test to be always less than or equal to 1
- fix blaker.exact and fisher.exact to work correctly when y!=NULL
- minor editing of some man pages
- minor editing of some code for clarity

0.9-1 First release
