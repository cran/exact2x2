\section*{McNemar's Original Test}
\label{sec-overview}

Consider paired binary response data. For example, suppose you have twins randomized to two treatment groups (Test and Control) then tested on a 
binary outcome (pass or fail). There are 4 possible outcomes for each pair: (a) both twins fail, 
(b) the twin in the control group fails and the one in the test group passes,
(c) the twin on the test group fails and the one in the control group passes, or (d) both twins pass.
Here is a table where the of the number of sets of twins falling in each of the four categories are denoted a,b,c and d: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Test} \\
Control & Fail  & Pass \\ \hline 
Fail & a & b \\
Pass & c & d \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In order to test if the treatment is helpful, we use only the number discordant pairs of twins, $b$ and $c$, since the other pairs of twins tell us nothing 
about whether the treatment is helpful or not. McNemar's test is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q \equiv Q(b,c) & = & \frac{ (b- c)^2 }{b+c}
\end{eqnarray*} 
which for large samples is distributed like a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom. A closer approximation to the chi-squared 
distributin uses a continuity correction: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q_C \equiv Q_C(b,c) & = & \frac{ \left( |b- c|-1 \right)^2 }{b+c}
\end{eqnarray*} 
In R this test is given by the function `mcnemar.test'.
 
Case-control data may be analyzed this way as well. Suppose you have a set of people with some rare disease (e.g., a certain type of cancer); these 
are called the cases. 
For this design you match each case with a contol who is as similar as feasible on all important covariates except the exposure of interest. Here is a table\footnote{Table was 
incorrect in original version.}:

\end{center}

For this case as well we can use $Q$ or $Q_C$ to test for no association between cases/control status and exposure status.
 
For either design, we can estimate the odds ratio by $b/c$, which is the maximum likelihood estimate (see Breslow and Day, 1980, p. 165).  

Consider some hypothetical data (chosen to highlight some points): 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Test} \\
Control & Fail  & Pass \\ \hline  
Fail & 21 & 9 \\
Pass & 2 & 12 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

When we perform McNemar's test with the continuity correction we get 
<<>>=
x<-matrix(c(21,9,2,12),2,2)
mcnemar.test(x)
@
Without the continuity correction we get 
<<>>=
mcnemar.test(x,correct=FALSE)

Since the inferences change so much, and are on either side of the traditional 0.05 cutoff of significance,
 it would be nice to have an exact version of the test to be clearer about significance at the 0.05 level. 
 We study that in the next section.

\section*{Exact Version of McNemar's Test}

After conditioning on the total number of discordant pairs, $b+c$, we can treat 
the problem as  
$B \sim Binomial(b+c, \theta)$, where $B$ is the random variable associated with $b$. 
The odds ratio from the unconditional model is equal to the odds associated with $\theta$ from the conditional model,\footnote{Revision to April 25, 2016 version.}
\begin{eqnarray}
 \mbox{Odds Ratio} \equiv  \phi  = \frac{\theta}{1-\theta} \label{orp}
\end{eqnarray}
 (Breslow and Day, 1980, p. 166). See Appendix~A for full explanation of equation~\ref{orp}. 
 Under the null hypothesis $\theta=.5$. 
Since it is easy to perform exact tests on a binomial parameter, we can perform exact versions 
of McNemar's test by using the `binom.exact' function of the package `exactci' then transform the results into odds ratios via equation~\ref{orp}. 
This is how the calculations are done in the `exact2x2' function when paired=TRUE. The `alternative' and the `tsmethod' options work in the way one 
would expect. So although McNemar's test was developed as a two-sided test, we can easily get one-sided exact McNemar-type Tests. For two-sided tests
we can get three different versions of the two-sided exact McNemar's test using the 
three `tsmethod' options.  In Appendix~B we show that all three two-sided methods give the same p-value and they all are equivalent to 
the exact version of McNemar's test. So there is only one defined exact McNemar's test. The difference between the 'tsmethod' options is 
in the calculation of the confidence intervals. The default is to use 'central' confidence intervals so that the 
probability that the 
true parameter is less than the lower $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval is guaranteed to be 
less than or equal to  $\alpha/2$, and similarly for the upper confidence interval. These guarantees on each tail are not true for the 'minlike' 
and 'blaker' two-sided confidence intervals.

Using $x$ defined earlier, here is the exact McNemar's test with the central confidence intervals:

\section*{Power for Exact McNemar Test}


McNemar's test is for paired binary observations. Let $Y_{i1}$ and $Y_{i2}$  be the responses from the 
$i$th pair, where $Y_{i1}$ is the response from the control individual in the pair, and $Y_{i2}$
is the response from the test individual in the pair. 
Let the response of the $i$th pair be $[Y_{i1}, Y_{i2}]$. Then there are only 4 types of pairs according to their responses, type a: $(0,0)$, type b: $(0,1)$, type c: $(1,0)$, and type d: $(1,1)$, which align with the 4 cells in the $2 \times 2$ table.  Let $\pi_a$, $\pi_b$, $\pi_c$ and $\pi_d$ denote the probability of observing a pair of each type.




The paired exact McNemar test (including one-sided versions) only uses the pairs of type b and c.
So for the power calculation we only need $\pi_b$, 
$\pi_c$, and the total number of pairs. 

The function {\sf powerPaired2x2} calculates the power of the exact McNemar test. 





Here is the result when $\pi_b=.5$ and $\pi_c=.3$ and the number of pairs equals $100$:

\section*{Appendix A: Relationship of Odds for Conditional Data and Odds Ratio for Unconditional Data} 

Let $Y_{ij}$ be the $j$th binary response from the $i$th pair. For example, $Y_{i1}$ could be the binary response from the twin randomized to the control group in the  $i$th set of twins,
and $Y_{i2}$ could be the binary response from the twin randomized to the test group in the $i$th set of twins. 
Let $\pi_{ij} = Pr[ Y_{ij}=1]$.  Then the odds ratio (i.e., ratio of odds(test)/odds(control)) for the $i$th set of twins is 
\[
\phi_i = \frac{\pi_{i2}/(1-\pi_{i2}) }{ \pi_{i1}/(1-\pi_{i1}) } =   \frac{\pi_{i2} (1-\pi_{i1})  }{ \pi_{i1} (1-\pi_{i2}) }.
\]
Suppose we have a logistic model with the log odds modeled as 
\[
\log \left( \frac{\pi_{ij}}{1-\pi_{ij}} \right) = \mu_i + I[j=2] \beta,
\]
where $I[j=2]=1$ when $j=2$ and $0$ when $j=1$,  $\mu_i$ is a random twin effect, and $\exp(\beta)$ is the effect of the test compared to the control on the log odds. 
Under this model, $\phi_i \equiv \phi =  \exp(\beta)$. In other words, the odds ratio does not change from twin set to twin set. 

Now consider conditioning on $Y_{i1}+Y_{i2}=1$, so that we only consider the pairs with one positive response. 
Then the probability that the test member passes under the above model conditioning that one member of the twin set passes is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_i & = & Pr[ Y_{i2}=1 | Y_{i1}+Y_{i2}=1, \mu_i, \beta ]  \\
 & = & \frac{Pr[ Y_{i2}=1 \mbox{ and } Y_{i1}=0 | \mu_i, \beta] }{Pr[ \left( Y_{i2}=1 \mbox{ and } Y_{i1}=0 \right) \mbox{ or } \left( Y_{i2}=0 \mbox{ and } Y_{i1}=1 \right) | \mu_i, \beta ]  }  \\
 & = & \frac{ \pi_{i2} (1-\pi_{i1}) }{ \pi_{i2} (1-\pi_{i1}) + \pi_{i1} (1-\pi_{i2})  }.
\end{eqnarray*}
Then the odds that the test member in the $i$th set passes, conditioning on only one member  passing, is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\theta_i}{1-\theta_i} & = & \frac{ \pi_{i2} (1-\pi_{i1}) }{  \pi_{i1} (1-\pi_{i2})  }  = \phi.
\end{eqnarray*}
By algebra, we can rewrite the conditional probability for the $i$th set, $\theta_i$, in terms of the conditional odds as
\[
\theta_i = \frac{\phi}{1+\phi}.
\]
So $\theta_i$ does not depend on $i$ and we write $\theta_i \equiv \theta$. 

If we take $n=b+c$ of these conditional pairs, then $B = \sum_{i: Y_{i1}+Y_{i2}=1}  Y_{i2}$ is binomial with parameters $n$ and $\theta$,
 where $\theta = Pr[ Y_{i2}=1 | Y_{i1}+Y_{i2}=1]$ is the probability of a postive response in a test member of a set with only one positive response. 
Then if we transform that probability into an odds we get $\theta/(1-\theta) = \phi$. 
In other words, the odds of the conditional random variable is the same as the odds ratio of interest under the full unconditional model. 
  
\section*{Appendix B: Equivalence of two-sided p-values} 

For the two-sided exact tests, the sample space is $B \in \{ 0,1,\ldots, b+c \}$. Let $n=b+c$ and let the binomial mass function under the null hypothesis 
of $\theta=.5$ (i.e., $\phi=1$) be  
\[
f(x) =  \left( \begin{array}{c} n \\ x \end{array} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{x} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-x} = 
2^{-n} \left( \begin{array}{c} n \\ x \end{array} \right).
\]
 The exact McNemar p-value is defined as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_e & = & \sum_{x: Q(x,n-x) \geq Q(b,c)} f(x)
\end{eqnarray*}


Here are the definitions of the exact p-values for the three two-sided methods. For the `central' method, it is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_c & = & \min \left\{ 1, 2 * \min \left( F(x),\bar{F}(x) \right) \right\} 
\end{eqnarray*}
where $F(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} f(i)$ and $\bar{F}(x)=1-F(x-1)$ and $F(-1)=0$. For the `minlike' method 
the p-value is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_m & = & \sum_{x: f(x) \leq f(b)} f(x)
\end{eqnarray*}
For the `blaker' method the p-value is
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_b & = & \sum_{x: \min \left\{F(x), \bar{F}(x) \right\} \leq \min \left\{ F(b), \bar{F}(b) \right\}  } f(x) 
\end{eqnarray*}

To show the equivalence of $p_e, p_c, p_m,$ and $p_b$ we 
first rewrite the summation indices in $p_e$. Note that 
\[
Q(x,n-x) = \frac{ 4 (x  - \frac{n}{2})^2 }{n}
\] 
so the summation indices may be rewritten as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\{x: Q(x,n-x) \geq Q(b,c) \right\} = \left\{x: \left| x - \frac{n}{2} \right| \geq \left| b- \frac{n}{2} \right| \right\}  \label{eq:abs}
\end{eqnarray}
In other words, $p_e$ is just the sum of $f(x)$ for all $x$ that are as far away or further from the center ($n/2$) as $b$.
Note that $f(x)$ is increasing for all $x<n/2$ and decreasing for all $x>n/2$. Further note that  $f(x)=f(n-x)$ for all $x$ so that   
$F(x) = \bar{F}(n-x)$ for all $x$. Thus, it makes sense that all 4 p-values are equivalent for the case when $\theta=.5$.


Here are the details showing the equivalence. We break up the possibilities into three cases: 
\begin{description}
\item[Case 1, $b=n/2$:] In this case,  from equation~\ref{eq:abs}, the whole sample space is covered so $p_e=1$. Also $F(x)=\bar{F}(x) > 1/2$ so $p_c=1$.
Because the unique peak of the $f(x)$ function happens at $n/2$ when $n$ is even ($n$ must be even when $b=n/2$), we can see that $p_m=1$. Also because of that 
peak,   $\min \left\{F(x), \bar{F}(x) \right\}$ is maximized at $b=n/2$ and $p_b=1$.
\item[Case 2, $b<n/2$:]  In this case, the set of all $x$ described by equation~\ref{eq:abs} is all $x \leq b$ and all $n-x \geq n-b$ so that $p_e=F(b)+\bar{F}(n-b)$.
Also, $\min \left\{ F(x), \bar{F}(x) \right\}$ is $F(x)$, and 
\[
F(x) = \sum_{i: f(i) \leq f(x) \mbox{ and } i<n/2} f(i).
\]
Further, 
\[
F(x)=\bar{F}(n-x) = \sum_{i: f(i) \leq f(x) \mbox{ and } i>n/2} f(i).
 \] 
 So $p_c = 2*F(b) = F(b)+\bar{F}(n-b) = 
  \sum_{i: f(i) \leq f(b)} f(i)$ which is equivalent to $p_m$. Also since $F(x)=\bar{F}(n-x)$ we can see that all values of 
  $x$ with $\min \left\{F(x), \bar{F}(x) \right\} \leq F(b)$ will also give the same p-value and $p_b$ is equivalent to the other p-values.
\item[Case 3, $b>n/2$:] By symmetry, we can show through similar arguments to Case 2 that all 4 p-values are equivalent.
